The winner will be announced at the end of the final event and the prize will be awarded on the same occasion.</em></p><p>By combining arts and science we aim to prompt a well-rounded reflection by activating both the emotional and rational path in our minds, favouring a balanced thinking process that will include both empathetic and analytic reasoning. By raising awareness in our audience, we aim to prompt people to strive to reduce social inequality in their everyday life by taking actions, even small ones.</p><p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions
