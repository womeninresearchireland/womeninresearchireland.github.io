Similarly,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">their long-term negative effects on both single individuals and society as a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">whole, are not immediately and easily perceived without the support of rigorous&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">research.</span></p><p>(UN)PRIVILEGED, a project born from the collaboration between Women in&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Research Ireland (WIRI – charity No: 20200957) and the Equality Fund in Trinity&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">College Dublin, aimed to raise awareness of the multifaceted nature of social&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">inequalities and their consequences.</span></p><p>To achieve this, (UN)PRIVILEGED tackled this issue combining the points of view&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">of arts and science. In the past months, WIRI ran a photo contest asking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">contestants to capture through their lens the gap between privilege and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">disadvantage.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The contest was an international success, with 59 entries from 10 different&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Countries worldwide including Bangladesh, India, Moldova, United Arab&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Emirates, and Brazil.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The entries were evaluated by a panel composed of professional photographer&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Mark Nixon, WIRI committee member Cathy Corcoran, and Trinity researcher&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Anna Truzzi.</span></p><p>The winning and shortlisted photographs, attached to this article, were printed&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">and showcased during a free in-person award ceremony which took place on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Thursday June 30th in Trinity College Dublin.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">During the award ceremony, Prof. Yekaterina Chzhen, assistant professor in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Sociology at Trinity College Dublin and world-renowned expert on poverty and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">inequality across the life course, presented her research results about the longterm effects of social inequalities on individuals and society. This was followed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">by the announcement of the winner of our photographic contest selected by our&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">panel of judges.</span></p><p>The winning picture, shot by Syed Mahabubul Kader in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">titled “Fire Incident” portrays people surrounding the remains of a car previously&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">engulfed in flames from a fire attributed to illegal storage of chemicals in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">unregulated warehouses, highlighting how living in a healthy place is a privilege&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">not shared by all human beings.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The other shortlisted photographs portrayed different perspectives of social&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">inequalities. “Life in a Rice Mill”, shot by Asker Ibne Firoz in Bangladesh,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">highlights how gender gap has roots in childhood by showing a girl working while&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">a boy from the same family plays riding a bicycle. “Limitations”, shot by Srimanta&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Ray in India, highlights how having special education needs can be a sharp&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">disadvantage for the individuals if those needs are not recognized or met. “Bed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">and table”, shot by Rose Battistella in Brazil, shows some indirect economic&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">consequences of Covid-19 which contributed to deepen the gap between&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">opposite ends of the socio-economic status.</span></p><p>By showcasing the photos and reporting scientific results about long-term&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">consequences of disadvantage in our society, (UN)PRIVILEGED aimed to give its&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">audience a moment to reflect, promoting awareness and maybe prompting&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">people to strive to reduce social inequality in their everyday life by taking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">actions, even small ones.</span></p><p>We are grateful to all the photographer who participated in the contest and to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Trinity College Equality Office for sponsoring both the photo contest and the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">award ceremony, allowing us to develop such an innovative and impactful&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">project.</span></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p><br></p><p>As an organisation committed to gender inequality and focused on supporting women and minorities in academia in Ireland, WIRI (Women in Research Ireland) is involved in a variety of activities related to promoting gender equality measures in the higher education sector.</p><p>On 9 June 2022, WIRI was invited to address the expert group in charge of the Second Review of Gender Equality in Irish Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), which is ongoing until October 2022. This review is evaluating progress on gender equality since 2016, analysing progress to date.
</p><p>Representing WIRI in the online meeting, WIRI’s Co-director, Dr Valesca Lima offered insights on the issue of gender equality amongst higher education staff and progress made towards advancing gender equality since the first review, released in 2016. In particular, she highlighted some recent advances, such as the increasing availability of disaggregated data, the implementation of gender quotas at the governance and management level, the creation of the SALI (Senior Academic Leadership Initiative) program and the tying research funding with gender equality by funders like the Irish Research Council. 
</p><p>Despite discreet advances, some areas are still seeing little progress. Dr Lima highlighted that women's academic career progression remains very slow. For example, 18% of professors were female in 2013, in 2020 it had only increased to  27%. On this she commented:
</p><p>‘HEIs have invested in promoting gender parity at the highest levels, but some structural barriers remain'.
</p><p>The issue of precarious jobs in academia was also discussed. Dr Lima highlighted that women and ethnic  minorities are over-represented in precarious academic jobs, occupying 71% of temporary part-time academic positions. This precariousness has an impact on migrant academics, who in addition to facing low wages and discrimination, have to deal with the challenge of finding a stable job. To close the meeting, the group of experts requested that the 'big asks' or high level goals be included in the second review. Dr Lima  explained that these big demands must involve new policies for retaining women in the academic labour market, a better financial structure oriented towards gender equality and the end of the extreme dependence on temporary and precarious employment in the Irish third level.
</p><p>The consultation event was also attended by representatives from the Irish Precarity Network and Women in Technology and Science Ireland, and Professor Kathleen Lynch, in addition to members of the Expert Group, Dr Karl Kitching and Dr Philip Owende.

</p><p>On Tuesday 29 March 2022, WIRI’s co-director Arjumand Younous addressed the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science roundtable on the future funding for higher education. Drawing from recent data, Dr Younous discussed the future funding for the Irish third level, focusing on issues related to the impact of the funding crisis in higher education on women and minority groups.
</p><p>WIRI was joined on the occasion by other entities active in the defence of a research system with long-term and stable funding, such as Irish Research Council (IRC), the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI); and the Irish Precarity Network.
</p><p>In its statement, WIRI highlighted the need for the creation of permanent, project-independent positions and professorships in higher education institutions that demonstrate gender and racial equality. In particular, WIRI called for the collaboration of all research stakeholders to improve the governance and management of research careers and promote inclusion and diversity in Irish higher education.</p><p><strong>Links: </strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">1. </span><a href="assets/files/Full-version-WIRIstatementtotheJointCommitteeonEducationFurtherandHigherEducationResearchInnovationandScienceon29.pdf" class="text-primary" style="font-size: 1.2rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">WIRI's opening statement</a><br></p><p>2. <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/oireachtas-tv/video-archive/committees/5493" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Full streaming of the Joint Committee</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/joint_committee_on_education_further_and_higher_education_research_innovation_and_science/2022-03-29/3/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Full transcript of the Future Funding of Higher Education on Discussion  on 29 March 2022</a></p></div>

</p><p>condemns Russia’s brutal invasion of the country. We call on Russia to immediately
</p><p>withdraw its forces and end this illegal occupation of a sovereign state.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Russia has created a humanitarian catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. Every day, those
</p><p>fleeing Ukraine are forced to seek shelter from the indiscriminate bombardment of their
</p><p>civic spaces. Many have been forced to flee into neighbouring states as refugees.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Our governments must provide a safe haven for all refugees. They have a basic human right
</p><p>to security, shelter and dignity. The most vulnerable people urgently need provisions,
</p><p>protection and financial assistance.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>As a platform for women in research, advocating rights and policies for the advancement of
</p><p>women academics, WIRI expresses its solidarity with academic women fleeing Ukraine.
</p><p>Russian threats of violence and death have led to a mass exodus of scientists and
</p><p>academics. This is not only an attack on academic freedom and opportunities for scientific
</p><p>cooperation, but also on the principles of freedom and democracy that provide the basis for
</p><p>international research.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>WIRI firmly believes that the advancement of scientific knowledge and innovation is based
</p><p>on a stable global order and peaceful collaboration among scholars of all nations. We call on
</p><p>the international community to strongly condemn Russia's armed aggression and work
</p><p>towards an end to this violence.

</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2021
</em></strong></p><p><em>Submission from Women in Research Ireland (RCN:20200957)
</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p>Women in Research Ireland (WIRI) is a registered charity based in Dublin and a group member
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">of the National Women’s Council of Ireland. WIRI’s vision is to achieve equitable&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">representation for women and minority groups in Irish higher education. WIRI’s mission is to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">unite and build an empowering diverse and inclusive community of underrepresented groups&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">where all voices are heard in academic spaces. The WIRI committee welcomes the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">opportunity to provide a submission on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><strong>1. Addressing the needs of staff in Higher Education
</strong></p><p>It is essential that the legislation directly addresses the importance of the needs of all staff in&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">higher education in particular women and minority groups. The detrimental and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">disproportionate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the academic careers of women and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">minorities across the world are widely reported particularly for those with caring&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">responsibilities (Deryugina et al. 2021). There is an urgent need to mitigate this damaging&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">effect on the career progression of women and others who have been most adversely&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">effected.</span></p><p>In Irish Higher Education Institutions, those on part-time temporary contracts are&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">predominantly women. The Higher Education Authority Higher Education Institutional Staff&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">by Gender Report highlights that in 2019, 26% of professor posts were filled by women as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">compared to 74% held by men. 52% of academics on full-time temporary contracts were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">female, while 71% of those on part-time temporary contracts were female. There is an urgent&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">need for better career training and supports for staff on precarious temporary contracts&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">(postdoctoral researchers, research fellows, teaching fellows). While the focus on student&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">success is correctly a central focus of the General Scheme, we recommend that supports for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">staff success feature more strongly in the General Scheme (in Objects and General Functions&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">of An tÚdarás).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>2. Equality, diversity and inclusion for staff in Higher Education
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The ethos of Women in Research Ireland is that equity and diversity creates a positive impact
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">in Higher Education and furthers the enhancement of science, health-care and the wider&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">society. To advance equality, diversity and inclusion in Irish Higher Education, issues such as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">workplace bullying, harassment, unfair management and an inadequate complaints system&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">need to be explicitly addressed. There is a need for suitable mechanisms for gathering&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">feedback on staff issues relating to the theme of equality, diversity and inclusion. We strongly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">recommended that a focus on equality, diversity and inclusion supports for staff in Higher&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Education features prominently within the upcoming General Scheme.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">We would be happy to engage further on any aspect of this submission.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>Kicking off the event Prof Linda Doyle stated that, “no matter what happens on April 10th we can be sure of one thing that Trinity will have its first woman Provost and perhaps George Salmon will be rolling in his grave forever more”. Provost Rev. George Salmon, who fiercely opposed the admission of female students to the University and whose statue is firmly rooted in Trinity front square, famously said during his term as Provost from 1888 to 1904, “over my dead body will women enter the college” (1).  In Professor Doyle’s manifesto, Imagine Trinity she invites us to imagine the future we want at Trinity and to take action to realize that future (2). The two themes running through Imagine Trinity are power and fairness, themes which align with Women in Research IE’s own mission in building a united community where silenced voices are heard in academic spaces. Prof. Doyle says, “the Academy has always been structured to listen to some voices more than others” allowing a deeply unfair system to prevail in institutions throughout the centuries. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Second to speak was Prof Jane Ohlmeyer whose manifesto is titled, Empowering Trinity (3). Prof Ohlmeyer described to us her experience of falling pregnant with her first son while still doing her PhD at Trinity and the considerate support she received from her supervisor. She highlighted the necessity of a supportive supervisor and mentors during women’s career as well as the essential need for outstanding nursery care. Trinity still lacks important provisions for women with young children, for instance, only three breastfeeding rooms exist in the college (4). Prof Ohlmeyer reflected on the challenges she has faced in Trinity to address the conservatism, the hierarchy and in pockets, the misogyny that she has seen throughout her career. On her first day at Trinity as Erasmus Professor of Modern History in 2003, she recalls vividly the then Junior Dean asking why the new secretary was in the professor’s office. Prof Ohlemyer concluded by saying that, “Trinity has come a long way…but the truth is that we have a long, long, way to go”, stating that she is “almost embarrassed” that Ireland is the last country in the European Union to appoint a female as President of a university
</p><p>
</p><p>Third up, we heard from Professor Linda Hogan, who discussed the importance of this historic election. She stated that our concepts of university leader and Provost are entirely determined by a male model, and that we have to re-imagine the Provostship itself as a “leader for cultural change”. Her manifesto is centered around this concept of living our values and this is what she says we must do in Trinity and academia generally (5). The principles in her manifesto focus on a culture that nurtures and that is driven by generosity of spirit and promotion of true equality and diversity. She also discussed the importance of mentors and supporters for women and minorities and “the valuing of women’s voices in academia”, as well as the need to address inequalities in the system to break the current mold and map a way for greater inclusion and diversity. In her manifesto, she also maps out a specific proposal about addressing bullying and harassment in our University as well as addressing precarious contracts of work. 
</p><p><em>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Opening up the event to our attendees, we had several questions posed to the candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><strong>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The first question focused on the effect of the pandemic on the work of those with caring responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Prof Doyle began by discussing the statistics that show the drop off in the numbers of women submitting for publication during the pandemic, which is particularly impacting early career researchers the hardest. The three candidates stated that the problem needs addressing from a systemic point of view. Prof Doyle stated that she is looking at a much fairer promotion system in the first place, designed to take into account maternity and paternity leave and disruptions to research more effectively. Prof Ohlmeyer referred to the Irish Research Council, the first council to fund costed extensions during the pandemic. She believes that the University can lead and do an awful lot more than it is currently doing. In Prof Hogan’s view the systemic response would focus on redress, that it is the only way we can deal with systemic and embedded inequalities. She also commented on the responsibility of the university as a workplace in supporting psychological well-being of its staff and students. 
</p><p><strong>The next question from the audience asked the candidates about their support for PhD workers' rights.
</strong></p><p>Organisations such as PhD Workers' Rights Group are campaigning for workers' rights for PhD candidates across Ireland, similar to universities in Sweden where PhD candidates have a salary and other standard benefits of employment (6). Prof Doyle and Prof Ohlmeyer discussed the inequality of the tiered system that exists for PhD candidates where various different classes of PhD terms of work exist and the urgent needs to address this. Prof Doyle commented that we need better contractual certainty and obligations to PhD candidates to provide clarity around expectations of both them and supervisors. Prof Doyle and Prof Hogan both expressed their uncertainty about supporting workers' rights for PhDs with Prof Doyle stating that the research system isn’t adequately funded to increase the cost of PhD individuals as workers. She reinstated that a better approach for PhDs is to employ strong contractual obligation that are outside an employee type situation while still working to improve stipend situation. Both Prof Ohlmeyer and Prof Hogan commented that when it comes to any sort of improved conditions for early career researchers, we need to agree at a national level in order to have an understanding and a baseline of what are the acceptable conditions and minimum thresholds for all PhD candidates. 
</p><p><strong>How would you leverage equality, diversity and inclusion and combat discrimination such as racism and homophobia on campus?
</strong></p><p>Prof Ohlmeyer emphasised her zero-tolerance approach to bullying, racism and homophobia in the University. She discussed her own experience of being trolled online and the need for creating an online environment where academic freedom is preserved. She commented that there are many policies in place at Trinity that aren’t implemented which needs addressing. Prof Hogan mentioned that Trinity and all universities should be bullying and harassment free zones. She discussed the inadequacies of the current complaints system at the university which she compared to best practices in Australian universities where confidential registers and meaningful investigations and penalties are in place. 
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>Currently being a researcher is quite precarious at Trinity, it is often difficult for a postdoc to get funding and without a PI trying to get project funding your contract can end and there is no possibility of continuing in research at Trinity.  Do you have any plans for creating a pathway to enable research careers at Trinity?&nbsp;</strong></span><br></p><p>Prof Ohlmeyer believes that we need to create additional opportunities for our early career researchers in Trinity and across Ireland, that universities need to be thinking about wider career advice for these researchers. There is a need to better prepare this group for the workplace, such as creating opportunities for internships in enterprise as is practice in the Trinity Long Room Hub. Prof Hogan stated the need to create additional and new career opportunities for researchers in Trinity and in the Irish higher education sector more generally, also stating that the inequities in the current system, namely precarious contracts, need addressing. She went on to say that there is a need to ensure an encouraging and empowering approach to postgraduate and research careers instead of the current punitive one in place. Prof Doyle then referred to the National Research career framework in place at Trinity, however noting that it has not been adequately applied or put into action. 
</p><p>
</p><p>The election for the Provost will take place on Saturday 10 April 2021 and the new Provost will take up office on 1 August 2021.
