Current research focuses on the intersection of Islamic Finance and the West coupled with passion for financial regulation and social responsibility. While finance is seen as a neutral space she has seen the effects of gender imbalance not just in research but in corporate spaces. The representation of women and minorities is vital to positive, informed decisions. She joined WIRI in 2020 to support the aims of the organisation.
