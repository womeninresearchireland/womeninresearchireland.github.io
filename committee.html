              <p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">Dr <strong>Anna </strong>Viola Sborgi is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellow at the Department of Film and Screen Media, University College Cork, Ireland, where she also teaches modules on the Home on Screen and Sustainable Futures in Global Cinema. Her research interests are in film, media, and urban studies. She was previously Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Genoa, Italy. She holds a PhD in Film Studies (King’s College London) and a PhD in Comparative Literature (University of Genoa). Recent publications include “Grenfell on Screen” in After Grenfell: Violence, Resistance and Response (Pluto Press, 2019) and “Housing Problems: Britain’s Housing Crisis and Documentary” in Cinema of Crisis: Film and Contemporary Europe (EUP, July 2020).
<br>
<br>Her current project, <a href="https://mediahomesproject.com/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">MEDIAHOMES: Housing Precarity on Screen in Ireland</a>, Portugal and the UK from the 2008 crisis to COVID-19, investigates mediations of housing precarity across Ireland, the UK and Portugal from the 2008 crisis to COVID-19. It develops a transnational model to analyse media representations of the home and how its transformation into a site of creative labour during the global pandemic intersects with socioeconomic and, in particular, gender inequality. Gender is a the core of her research and she joined WIRI as an ordinary committee member because she is passionate about equality and wider representation of women and under-represented groups in academia and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

Sandrine’s research centres on third generation African writers, such as Afrofuturists, who have emerged during the era of late liberalism and who have introduced multiple and nuanced perspectives for reflecting on African lives and aspirations. She recently co-produced a documentary entitled Unsilencing Black Voices which details personal stories and accounts by members of the black community in Ireland. Sandrine’s work now highlights the need to the lived experiences of the Black and Irish community with her recent publication of her essay ‘Irishness does not mean whiteness’.&nbsp;</p>
