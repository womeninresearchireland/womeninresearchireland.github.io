She is an Assistant Professor in the Discipline of Physiology at Trinity College Dublin and works in close collaboration with the Academic Unit of Neurology at Trinity College Dublin. Roisin's interests encompass how disruption of neuronal function leads to neurodegenerative disease, from microscopic to macroscopic scales. She is particularly interested in how we can sensitively, economically and non-invasively measure normal and impaired brain activity using electrophysiological methods. Roisin is particularly focused on undertaking clinically translatable research, which can lead to more accurate detection, prediction and treatment of diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neurone Disease and Huntington's Disease. She also works with those developing potential therapies for neurological diseases to help optimise clinical trial designs.&nbsp;<br>
